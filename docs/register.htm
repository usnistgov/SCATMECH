        <hr>

        <p>The SCATMECH software package was developed at the
        <a href="http://www.nist.gov">National Institute of
        Standards and Technology</a> by employees of the Federal
        Government in the course of their official duties. Pursuant
        to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code this
        software is not subject to copyright protection and is in
        the public domain. SCATMECH is an experimental system. NIST
        assumes no responsibility whatsoever for its use by other
        parties, and makes no guarantees, expressed or implied,
        about its quality, reliability, or any other
        characteristic. We would appreciate acknowledgment if the
        software is used. This software can be redistributed and/or
        modified freely provided that any derivative works bear
        some notice that they are derived from it, and any modified
        versions bear some notice that they have been modified.</p>

        <p>Registration of the SCATMECH library is voluntary and
        enables you to be notified when new versions are released.
        It also enables you to provide feedback that helps us
        improve the library and its documentation. To register,
        send an e-mail message to <a href=
        "mailto:thomas.germer@nist.gov?Subject=SCATMECH%20Registration">
        thomas.germer@nist.gov</a>, indicating your interest in
        registering your copy of the software. Please include the
        following information</p>

        <p>This information will be used to maintain a software
        user's list. The information collected will enable NIST to
        send software updates, patches, bug reports, and pertinent
        information about the software to current users, to
        evaluate customer service, and to determine future
        priorities for developing new versions of the software. We
        will not distribute this list to commercial vendors.
        However, this information may be shared with other
        government agencies that co-sponsor our software
        development projects. This information may also be retained
        indefinitely as deemed necessary to distribute updates and
        information.</p>
